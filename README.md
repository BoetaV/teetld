//The aim of this project is to monitor the switch of clients between two major ARV regimens being rolled out
//Expectedly is that everyone should be on the latest regimen
//It is however noticable that some areas still take much longer to switch clients
//There is no clear proportionality between 2 regimens

With this project i wish to design a webApp that each Facility can
1. Register on System
2. Login and select facility for capturing
3. Report on various elements in system

I wish to achieve this using HTML, CSS and Javascript for frontend
AS backend i will use Node js with SQL
In the end i also wish to design a dashboard with indicaators at all level (a barometer for facility)
